# 🚀 CTO's Den

Welcome to the domain of a **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)** who lives and breathes **Kubernetes, AWS, microservices, AI, and self-hosted solutions**. If it scales, automates, or runs in a container—chances are, it's already on the radar.

## 🛠️ Tech Arsenal & Expertise

- **Kubernetes & GKE** – Because orchestrating containers is more fun than herding cats.
- **AWS & Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code, because manual setup is so last decade.
- **Kafka, Redis, MongoDB, Neo4j** – High-performance data streaming & storage for when speed matters.
- **NestJS & Angular 8** – Robust, scalable web applications that don’t crash under pressure.
- **PostgresML & AI Integration** – Machine learning meets databases for smarter decision-making.
- **Twilio & Voice AI** – Real-time AI-powered voice interactions, because chatbots are too mainstream.
- **X11 Window Manager** – For those who believe less is more (except when it comes to RAM).
- **Python** – Automating tasks, training AI models, and keeping things running smoothly.
- **Linux Expert** – Making systems faster, more secure, and just plain better.
